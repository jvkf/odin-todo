I have to say that this was sort of a "unwanted" project. Knowing the fame that Todo Apps generally have inside portfolios for Jr. devs, I struggled to find motivation to build this one as it was something that, using vanilla JS, seemed boring to me at this point. The whole picture changed when I started looking to test some different native features from Javascript that I never got to test it so far in a "real" application. It was interesting to try using .bind(), destructuring assignment and focusing on keeping things organized with modules - the main "reason" for this project originally at The Odin Project. I can't say that this is perfect as I want to move on and study more things, but I'm happy about the things (more importantly, the doubts) I achieved building this. One main concern to address in the future is the lack of a checking function for repeated titles of Projects (considering the whole app relies on the title field to manage the state of selected project and, therefore, all of the flow of the application is assuming that there won't be a repeated title).
